🪨 Rock vs Mine Prediction
This machine learning project classifies sonar signals to distinguish between rocks and mines using a supervised learning algorithm. It uses a dataset of sonar signals bounced off objects and trains a model to determine whether the object is a rock or a metal mine.

📌 Project Details
Project Type: Binary Classification

Dataset: UCI Sonar Dataset

Model Used: Logistic Regression

Language: Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Accuracy Achieved: Varies based on training split; typically ~85–90%

🧠 Features
📊 Uses sonar signal features (60 attributes per sample)

🔍 Trained a logistic regression model

📈 Evaluated model using accuracy score

💾 Supports user input for live prediction

🧪 Libraries Used

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
🚀 How to Run the Project
Clone the repository or download the notebook:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
Install the required libraries:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Run the notebook:

Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab:

jupyter notebook Copy_of_Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb
Test the model with user input:

Enter sonar features manually in the final input section to get predictions.


📈 Sample Output

Accuracy Score on test data: 0.8846
Prediction: The object is a Mine.
🧠 Future Enhancements
Add different classifiers (e.g., SVM, Random Forest)

Implement a web-based UI (e.g., using Streamlit or Flask)

Add confusion matrix and ROC curve visualization
